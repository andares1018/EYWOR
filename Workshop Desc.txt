[h1][b]What is this mod for:[/b][/h1]
This mod is aimed to create a more realistic Asian Theatre of World War II, which the vanilla game is severely lacking.

[h1][b]What does this mod do:[/b][/h1]
[b][i]IDEOLOGY[/i][/b]
　　Adds a new ideology Socialism. The ideology has its own political advisors and political events. Socialist countrys may or may not have elections, it depends on how you react to the political events. The reason for this is to properly position the Ideology of the Chinese Democratic League(has strong ties w/ the communists but somewhat democratic) and Shakai Taishuto(A socialist party that shares somewhat of a common ground w/ National Socialism).
　　Also, Non-aligned is now renamed Reactionary. World tension thresholds are also reduced. 

[b][i]PLAYABILITY[/i][/b]
◆ Current Nations w/ Comprehensive National Focuses:
　 – Japan, China, Communist China, Sinkiang, Mongolia
◆ Current Nations w/o completely unique National Focuses but are playable and have flavors:
　 – East Chahar, Pailingmiao Council, Northeastern Army, Guangxi, Burma, Sichuan
◆ Currently Playable Nations:
　 – Pretty much all of them, except for probably Kumul (too smol)

[h1][b]SPECIAL THANKS : [/b][/h1]
Huge thanks to Wanniang, the author of the East Focus mod
The prototype of this mod is based on roemer9’s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137402160]Better Realism Project[/url], which I partially participated in.
Although this mod has developed very differently from his mod, it won’t be here without his mod. 
The foreign advisors part was created by me, then later reintroduced to his mod.
The portraits of the mod is mostly adopted from VictorXoda’s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733860347]Black & White Portraits[/url]
