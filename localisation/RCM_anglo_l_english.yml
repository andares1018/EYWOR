 rcmanglo.1.t:0 "Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran"
 rcmanglo.1.d:0 "After the beginning of June 22, 1941 Operation Barbarossa, the British Empire and the Soviet Union took allied positions in relation to each other, which was the primary prerequisite for the invasion of Iran. In connection with the systematic advance of the Wehrmacht into the interior of the USSR, the Persian corridor, which passed through the territory of the Trans-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the land-lending program of the Lend-Lease. British and Soviet engineers recognized the enormous importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close scrutiny. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the sea ice covering in the Arkhangelsk region led to an increased danger of using this route, so the need for the use of the railway increased significantly. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-bearing areas and the rear of the Red Army and created a threat to the British military routes between India and the Mediterranean. Foreign Minister Ali Sukheili signed the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian treaty with the British and Soviet ambassadors Andrei Smirnov and Rider Ballard, according to which Iran provided support for allied military and economic activities by civilian means."
