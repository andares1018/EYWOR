 news.1.t:0 "Song Zheyuan Declared Independence"
 news.1.d:0 "Song Zheyuan and the Political Council he led decided to declare independence from the Nanking Government. Song also announced that he is willing to have a friendly relationship with the Japanese. It is believed that someone is behind the scene pushing for this, but there hasn't been any concrete evidence showing that's the case. \n\nSome experts commented that this event had allowed Japan to gain significant influence in the North China region, and could potentially disrupt the power balance between the Chinese Government and the Japanese Army. Some even claimed that this would lead to an total annexation of Hebei by Japan, but these claims are dismissed by the general public as "fearmongering"."

When approaching the border, the work party was taken under fire by a local Japanese outpost. \n\n We have lodged a formal diplomatic protest, but the Japanese ambassador maintains that the work party was sent to move the markers to allow us to claim more territory.\n\nThe Japanese have assured us that they will respect the border but will not allow any "tampering" with the current demarcation and will respond with force should we attempt to do so.\n\n This effectively means that we can no longer move freely about our territory in the area."
