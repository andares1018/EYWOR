It was on the basis of these proposals that the Government of India Act, 1935 was built. Retroactively split in to the 'Government of India Act, 1935' and the 'Government of Burma Act, 1935' because of it's length, the Act granted large measures of autonomy to the provinces of British India, which ending the system of Diarchy introduced in the 1919 Act. It also resulted in the franchising of up to firty-five million Indians, through the introduction of direct elections. \n\nThe Act additionally reorganised many of the provinces within British India, with Burma to be governed along side India, not as a part of it. After the assention of the Act in August 1935, and a General Election having been held in November 1936, Burma is now in a fit state to be administered completely separate from the rest of British India."

 burma.3.t:0 "Replacement of the Governor of Burma"
 burma.3.d:0 "Following the transition of government away from the Premiership of Neville Chamberlain, the new Prime Minister has deemed it necessary to reappoint many existing ministers. The Minister of Agriculture, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, has served his country well, having worked to improve the heavily criticised agricultural policies. Dorman-Smith had instigated the Dig for Victory campaign in late 1940, which aimed to increase the food production from allotments. Now an out-going minister, having been replaced by Robert Hudson, we should find a fitting post for him. \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Dorman-Smith made a speech in 1939 to the East India Association, lamenting the fact that while the British had talked for years about self-government and reform in Asia, they had delivered very little of it which had damaged their credibility 'Neither our word nor our intentions are trusted in that part of the globe ... We have fed such countries as Burma on political formulae until they are sick at the very sight and sound of a formula, which has come, as far as my experience shows, to be looked upon as a very British means of avoiding a definite course of action.'"
