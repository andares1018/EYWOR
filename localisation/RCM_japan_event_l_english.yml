 rcmjapan.1.t:0 "China Refused Our Demand"
 rcmjapan.1.d:0 "Chinese authorities refused our demand. They say we Japanese have no rights on their soil. Looks like someone need to be taught a lesson."
 rcmjapan.1.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
 rcmjapan.2.t:0 "China Accepted Our Demand"
 rcmjapan.2.d:0 "Surprisingly, the Chinese have chosen to let us gaurantee Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Independence. They probably didn't even realize that's just part of our plan. Anyway, we've also sent some officers to talk to Song Zheyuan, they should flip to our side within few weeks."
 rcmjapan.2.a:0 "Great."
 rcmjapan.3.t:0 "Border Skirmish: Soviet Victory"
 rcmjapan.3.d:0 "The Russians and their Mongolian lap dogs detected the build-up of our troops in Heilungkiang, and responded with a large raid across the border before our preparations had been completed! Our forces were badly mauled in the intense skirmishing that followed before the two sides disengaged."
 rcmjapan.3.a:0 "How could this have happened?!"
 rcmjapan.4.t:0 "Border Skirmish: Japanese Victory"
 rcmjapan.4.d:0 "The Russians and their Mongolian lap dogs detected the build-up of our troops in Heilungkiang, and attempt to launch a large raid across the border to disrupt out preparations! Fortunately, our quick-thinking commanders caught their forces in a pincer movement. We inflicted severe losses on their forces before they fled back across the border."
 rcmjapan.4.a:0 "That will teach them!"
 rcmjapan.5.t:0 "Soviet Withdrawal"
 rcmjapan.5.d:0 "After detecting our troop build-up, the Soviets wisely chose to withdraw their forces from the areas immediately adjacent to the Manchurian border. Our soldiers have temporarily occupied several of their abandoned border outposts. This will hopefully put an end to the ludicrous border claims the Russians and their Mongolian allies have been putting forward."
 rcmjapan.5.a:0 "A show of force was all it took."
 rcmjapan.6.t:0 "The French Accept Our Demands"
 rcmjapan.6.d:0 "The French have agreed to our demands, and their bases and facilities in Indochina are at our complete disposal. They have effectively turned over full control of their colony to us."

 rcmjapan.7.t:0 "The French Refuse Our Demands"

 rcmjapan.8.t:0 "Germany Recalls Advisors"
 rcmjapan.8.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to recall all of their advisors from China. They should be boarding planes bound for Berlin even now. Germany recognizes that the future of Greater East Asia belongs to Japan, not China."
 rcmjapan.8.a:0 "And so they should."
 rcmjapan.9.t:0 "Germany Refuses Our Request"
 rcmjapan.9.d:0 "The Germans have refused to recall their advisors from China, despite the fact that their military mission interferes directly with our plans for East Asia! Do they not see that this erodes the foundation for our nations to build diplomacy on? Can the Germans even be trusted?"
 rcmjapan.9.a:0 "Then their advisors will die with the rest of the Chinese."
 rcmjapan.11.t:0 "Issue Ultimatum to Siam"
 rcmjapan.11.d:0 "Amassing troops in Indochina, close to the Siamese border, we have made it clear that our intent to use their land as a base for freeing Southeast Asia from European colonialism is sincere. Hopefully, by allowing them the option of joining us in a military alliance, effectively making Siam a puppet state of the Japanese Empire, we can avoid a meaninglessly one-sided invasion. Of course, if they reject it, this will be tantamount to a declaration of war."
 rcmjapan.11.a:0 "We will enter Siam, regardless of what they say."
 rcmjapan.11.b:0 "In hindsight, threatening invasion is too aggressive."
 rcmjapan.12.t:0 "Japan Issues Ultimatum"
 rcmjapan.12.d:0 "Japan has been gathering forces close to our border for a long time and as suspected, their plan is to use our ports as bases for further expansion into Burma and Malaya. Now, they have presented us with the choices of submitting and allowing them to pass through or facing invasion.\n\nAlthough this could be seen as giving up our sovereignty and turning us into a Japanese puppet state, avoiding a war may be in our best interest."
 rcmjapan.12.a:0 "We will agree to an alliance with Japan."
 rcmjapan.12.b:0 "We will not surrender our independence so easily!"
 rcmjapan.13.t:0 "Siam Accepts Ultimatum"
 rcmjapan.13.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has wisely decided to accept our ultimatum and forge a military alliance between our nations. Effectively, we will be able to use Siam as a base for future operations in the Pacific."
 rcmjapan.13.a:0 "The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere grows stronger."
 rcmjapan.14.t:0 "Siam Rejects Ultimatum"
 rcmjapan.14.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has rejected our demands to enter Siam and our offer of a military alliance. Having announced our intent to enter regardless, this means war."
 rcmjapan.14.a:0 "Unfortunate that it would come to this."
 rcmjapan.15.t:0 "Indian National Army"
 rcmjapan.15.d:0 "Following our defeats of the British we have a great number of Indian prisoners of war. With the right persuasion, we could use those prisoners to bolster our forces..."

 rcmjapan.16.t:0 "A Puppet of Japan"
 rcmjapan.16.d:0 "The Japanese seek to control the wealth of China, and will not be stopped short of war. If we do not wish to fight them, we must submit to their control and become nothing more than a Japanese Puppet."
 rcmjapan.16.a:0 "We cannot fight"
 rcmjapan.16.b:0 "We must fight!"
 rcmjapan.17.t:0 "China submits"
 rcmjapan.17.d:0 "The cowardly Chinese have once again submitted to our demands, they have agreed to become a mere puppet of our nation."
 rcmjapan.17.a:0 "Their loss is our gain!"
 rcmjapan.18.t:0 "China refuses"
 rcmjapan.18.d:0 "The foolish Chinese have refused our perfectly reasonable request that we manage certain aspects of their government. We will need to conquer them if we want access to their resources."
 rcmjapan.18.a:0 "Shouldn't be difficult!"
 JAP_Indian_National_Army_arrives:0 "Two divisions of the Indian National Army arrive in Singapore."
 rcmjapan.34.t:0 "Expand Our Puppet State?"
 rcmjapan.34.d:0 "Chiang Kai-shek's Regime has finally fallen. China's future is in our hands now. We can either expand our Puppet Regime to indirectly rule our newly-conquered lands in China, or keep the status quo to maintain a better grip."
 rcmjapan.34.a:0 "Expand our puppet for stability."
 rcmjapan.34.b:0 "Keep the direct rule of our lands in China for a better control."

 rcmjapan.37.t:0 "Minseito Victory"
 rcmjapan.37.d:0 "Despite the growing tesion between the military and the government, the general election was held somewhat peacefully yesterday.

 rcmjapan.42.d:0 "A brand new cabinet has been established, but a most the corrupted and delusional officers around the Emperor has still not been removed. A full-scale purge is needed to completely eliminate the bad influences on the Emperor in the goverment."

 rcmjapan.43.d:0 "After several discussions within the Kōdōha, several major threats to the Kokutai have been specified and already held captive along the execution of the coup. The sooner we eliminate them the better we can secure the Kokutai of Japan."

 rcmjapan.44.t:0 "The Trial of Prince Kan'in Kotohito"
 rcmjapan.44.d:0 "Although Prince Kan'in Kotohito is a royal member and has not been considered a major threat to the Kokutai, he has been extremely against the doctrines of Kōdōha and often served as an agent of the Emperor to crack down on us. At this point, we can now either purge him for good or put him on house arrest. He is part of the royal family after all."
