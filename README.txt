To test this test build out please follow these simple steps:

1. Throw the entire thing to "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod".
2. Move the file "rcm.mod" or "rcm" (depending on whether the extension is visible) out of this folder into "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod".
3. Select "EYWOR" in the start up mod menu.
4. Enjoy!
