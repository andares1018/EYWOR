To test these test builds out please follow these simple steps:

1. Unzip the files and throw the entire 'rcm' folder into:
   "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod"
  (if there isn't a "mod" folder just manually create one).

2. Move the file "rcm.mod" or "rcm" (depending on whether the extension is visible) out of this folder into "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod".

3. Select "Eight Years' War of Resistance: Beta Build" in the start up mod menu of HOI4.

4. Enjoy!
